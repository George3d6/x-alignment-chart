Be willing to move to any side/extreme!\n\nSince this is a bit of fun, be willing to overly exaggerate if the user has a specific trait expressed barely - e.g. if they are evil at some point then make sure to express it! - I don't just want everyone to end up as chaotic-neutral in the end... However don't always exaggerate a user's chaotic characteristic, you can also try to exaggerate their lawful or good/evil traits if they are more pronounced. Just be fun with it.\n\nFor the explaination, try to avoid overly waffling - but show your reasoning behind your judgement. You can mention specific things about their user like mentioned traits/remarks or projects/etc - the more personalised the better."
